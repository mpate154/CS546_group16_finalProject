## üßæ Project Overview
Brief description of the project:
- Our Budget Tracker aims to make an intuitive yet useful tracker for anyone over the age of 12! Our data visualizations of monthly and yearly summaries make it simple to understand how you utilize your money. 
- This is a final project (though not final rendition) for CS 546 at Steven's Institute of Technology. We hope to expand this application into one we can use ourselves.

## üöÄ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CS546_group16_finalProject.git
    cd CS546_group16_finalProject
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. (For graders) Run the seed
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```
   The seed will automatically populate the application with incomes and expenses from January 2022 to the current date.
   Other dates will be left blank so empty pages with no data can also be seen.
   
5. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
If you used the seed, use this login.

    - **Important note: the month selection feature on the income and expense pages only works on Chrome and Microsoft Edge, NOT Safari and FireFox.**

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage
- Create an account and login
- Add incomes/expenses by clicking on the income/expense tab. (First "add income" on Macs doesn't seem to show up unless you refresh the page)
    - Specify the amount earned/spent.
    - Add the date of the transaction (Dates before the year 2000 and after the current day are not allowed).
    - For expenses, specify the category.
    - (Optional) Add a description to precisely log your transaction. 
- Edit and delete incomes/expenses by clicking the icons in the table next to the specific transaction.
    - For edit, a form will appear with prefilled information. You can edit the income/expense, then hit submit. Go to the corresponding month to see the change. If you no longer want to edit, you can click the cancel button on the form. Then, any changes that were made in the form will not be applied.
    - For delete, that income/expense will immediately disappear from the table. 
- View your monthly and yearly summaries by navigating to the home page. Use the top navbar to toggle between the two summaries.
    - Click a category in the pie chart if you wish to view the chart without that category!
    - Fixed expenses are included in the monthly summary but not in the yearly summary.
- Adjust personal preferences in settings
    - Change your name, email, gender, age, city, state, and starting balance by clicking the "edit information" button. Once your changes are made, click the "save changes" button. If you no longer wish to edit this information, click "edit information" once again.
    - Note: If you change your age to below 13, it will not save as those under 13 are not permitted to use our app.
    - Add fixed expenses, their category, and amount. These are assumed to be monthly fixed expenses for the current month.
    - Note: Fixed expenses was originally going to be asked for during sign-up, but it's something that can be editted by the user in the settings at any time instead, for more flexibility. 
    - Add or remove categories.

## üî® Future Improvement
- Overall design/UI
- Create a seperate database to track fixed expenses for more than just the current month
- Add credit card features (multiple accounts tracked)
- Expense table for each credit card/debit card that is connected to the full summary expense table
- Customizable colors for the user 
- Spending Limit: Users have the option to create a goal that they want to keep their expenses under. 
- Yearly summary shows credit card limits versus balance and warns if they are close to the limit. 
- ‚ÄúForget password?‚Äù feature
